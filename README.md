# Setting up your computer for development

I really recommend that you use your own computer in my coding and data clases, especially if you own a Macintosh. Windows users will have more of a challenge, especially since this is the first year of a revamped coding class, but we'll work through issues.

I will concentrate on Macs first, as that is what is in our lab. If you are using a lab computer, most (but not all) of this will be done already.

Pay attention to verbal details given, as not all things may be installed or at the same time.
