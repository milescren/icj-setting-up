# Setting up your computer for development

I really recommend that you use your own computer in my coding and data classes. I use a Macintosh, so I'm more familiar with them, but students can use Windows for all the lessons and programs I use.

If you are using a lab computer, most (but perhaps not all) of this will be done already.

Pay attention to verbal details given, as not all things may be installed or at the same time.

## Part 1: VS Code, Git & Github

## Part 2: Node.js and npm

This part we will do later in the year, once we start using it.
