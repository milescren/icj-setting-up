# Starting up a UT Lab computer

Lab machines could get wiped on Monday mornings, so you might have to reset everything. You definitely will have to for the first time.

WORK IN PROGRESS

* This needs to be added to the `.bash_profile`.

```bash
# adds enhanced git prompt if installed
GIT_PROMPT_ONLY_IN_REPO=1
source ~/.bash-git-prompt/gitprompt.sh

# Add Visual Studio Code (code)
export PATH="$PATH://Users/ccm346/Desktop/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
```
